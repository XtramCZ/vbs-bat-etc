# Small scripts with vbs/bat/other made by me.

## Fork bomb
**This will make your PC unusable until you restart it, be careful.**
- If 10 fork bombs at once aren't enough for you, use the python generator to generate as much as you want.
- Then just run start.bat, it will create a new cmd window for every script you have in the bombs folder

## Desktop flood
- ...floods your desktop with files

## Google Chrome.lnk
**This will shut down your PC and delete itself.**
- Create a link file called "Google Chrome" on your desktop, and paste the contents [from this file](Google%20Chrome.lnk) into the input
  - If you want to rename it, you also have to change the name in the script
- If you want, give it an icon to look more legit
  - The default path for the icon is <em>C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe</em>
- Now when someone opens it, the pc will shut down and the file will self-destruct :)

## Hydra
- Everytime you try to close it, 2 more windows appear.
- If you really want to close it, use task manager.
